/**
 * TradingView REST API Specification for Brokers
 *
 * ## Overview   This API is to be implemented by the Brokers in order to connect their backend systems to TradingView, that acts as a frontend.    Check the [info page](https://www.tradingview.com/brokerage-integration/) for more info and use the contact form there if you have any questions.    ### Types of requests   There are two types of requests — client and server.   Client requests are executed at the browser. Server requests are initiated from the TradingView servers.   If your integration does not imply brokerage data stream connection to the TradingView website -   then there won't be any server requests.    #### Clients requests   From the browser TradingView requests the info (list of orders and positions, balance info, etc.) from the broker’s server.   The requests are sent periodically and the intervals can be set by using the [/config](#operation/getConfiguration) endpoint.   After that, TradingView compares the new data with the previous answer and calculates the difference.   If the status of the order/position changes or new data appears - the user will see a notification and the changes   will display in the Account manager on the website.    Requests to the [endpoints](/rest-api-spec/#tag/Trading) for placing/modifying orders, positions closing, etc. occur only after actions made by the user.    The [/quotes](#operation/getQuotes) endpoint retrieves the current bid/ask from the broker.   The [/depth](#operation/getDepth) endpoint retrieves Level 2 market data.    #### Server requests   In case if a Broker provides any Forex or CFD trading access for its clients it will require connection   of its own market data at TradingView. In order to make it possible, you will need to implement the following endpoints -     [/symbol_info](#operation/getSymbolInfo), [/history](#operation/getHistory) and [/streaming](#operation/streaming).   Data requests are sent from different TradingView servers. Usually, at least 4 servers are used.   The historical data is cached on TradingView servers and loaded to the client browser from our servers.    ### Restricting access to data   By default, the broker symbols will be available in the symbol search at TradingView and all the community   will have access to your data streams without any limitation. In order to limit the access to your data streams   please use the following endpoints - [/groups](#operation/getGroups) and [/permissions](#operation/getPermissions).    You can find more information about restricting access to the data in the description of these endpoints.    ### Change log   1.3.27.
